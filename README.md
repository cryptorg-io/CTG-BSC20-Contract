# CTG-BSC20-Contract

## Cryptorg token (CTG)

From May 1, 2019 to August 10, 2022, the platform provided users with the possibility of trading mining (Trade-to-mine) through trading bots. To accrue rewards, an ERC20 token was issued on the Ethereum network, followed by a re-issue of BEP20 on the BSC network. Rewards were awarded for each successful transaction completed by the bot in the form of tokens, as well as for all holders with a balance of more than 100,000 CTG.

After the end of mining, a new roadmap was created for the development of the Cryptorg project and the CTG token.
